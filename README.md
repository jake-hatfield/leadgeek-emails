# Leadgeek Emails

These are the email templates currently in use for [Leadgeek v2](https://leadgeek.io). I built these templates using [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/) which has been fun and easy to use.

I open-sourced sourced this code because I enjoy the design I created and the simplicity of writing emails in Markdown. After writing, it's as simple as building the project and uploading the production code to your email marketing service of choice.
