## // I have a small favor to ask 💭

How did you hear about Leadgeek and what are you hoping to get out of it?

Even though this email is automated, I personally read every response. You don't have to write an essay (though you can if you want to), but even a few words would be super helpful.

If you have any questions, just reply to my emails, [contact support](https://leadgeek.io/contact), or email [support@leadgeek.io](mailto:support@leadgeek.io).

CYA for now ✌️,

Jake
